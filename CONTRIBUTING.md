# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Wavebreaker!
There are several ways in which you can contribute to the project:

## Non-code

You may open [issues](https://github.com/AudiosurfResearch/wavebreaker-rs/issues) to report bugs or to suggest features.

## Code

### Get started

Make sure you [have Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). We use the latest nightly version. To install it using `rustup`, simply run `rustup install nightly`.

Clone the repository, start making changes, and when you're done, you can submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/AudiosurfResearch/wavebreaker-rs/pulls) for a maintainer to review.

### What to work on?

Check the [issues](https://github.com/AudiosurfResearch/wavebreaker-rs/issues) for things that need to be worked on.

If you happen to find that there's something wrong with the code outside of what the existing issues mention, you may want to open a new issue about it.

### Code guidelines

We don't really have specific guidelines. Just make sure you have [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy#usage) check your code, avoid warnings where possible and format your code using `cargo fmt`. That's it!
