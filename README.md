# wavebreaker-rs
**EXTREMELY WIP!!!!!** (Yes, so much so that it's worth five exclamation marks!!!!!)

Config example:
```toml
[external]
steam_key = "saus"
```

To connect, use the latest Wavebreaker client with ``forceInsecure`` set to ``true`` in its config. This is only intended for local testing.
As of now, the objective is to get the game to work without complaints by feeding it example data. *The end goal is to have feature parity with the TypeScript version!*
